# Space-Invaders-Arduino-Uno-
This is a simple version of the Space Invaders game implemented on an Arduino Uno for my Microprocessor course at AUT.
I used an RGB matrix and the NeoPixels library and simulated the game on Proteus.

Additionally, there are two types of enemy movements available. Feel free to uncomment and try the alternative in the program code file.
